# Optimizer API

Model optimizers provide state-of-the-art optimization algorithms to train models. They are used to update the weights of the model in order to minimize a givenloss function.

## List of Optimizers

### SimCLR

SimCLR is a contrastive learning framework that learns representations by maximizing agreement between differently augmented views of the same data example via a contrastive loss in the latent space.

### Knowledge Distillation

### Masked AutoEncoders
